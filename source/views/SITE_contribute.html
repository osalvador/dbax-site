                            <p>dbax is a community driven project and accepts contributions of code and documentation from the community.
                                These contributions are made in the form of Issues or Pull Requests on the
                                <a href="https://github.com/osalvador/dbax" target="_blank">dbax repository</a> on GitHub.</p>
                            <p>Issues are a quick way to point out a bug. If you find a bug or documentation error in dbax then please check a few things first:
                            </p>
                          	<ul class="default">
                                <li>There is not already an open Issue</li>
                                <li>The issue has already been fixed (check the develop branch, or look for closed Issues)</li>
                                <li>Is it something really obvious that you fix it yourself?</li>
                                <li>If you are unsure if you have found a bug, then start a new thread in the dbax forum, in the
                                    <a href="http://forum.dbax.io.com/forum-xx.html" target="_blank">Issues section</a>!</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>
                                Reporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a Pull Request,
                                which is done by “Forking” the main repository and committing to your own copy.
                                This will require you to use the version control system called Git.
