                        </p>
                        <p>&ldquo;The Library&rdquo; refers to a covered work governed by this License,
                            other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
                        </p>
                        <p>An &ldquo;Application&rdquo; is any work that makes use of an interface provided
                            by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
                            Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
                            of using an interface provided by the Library.
                        </p>
                        <p>A &ldquo;Combined Work&rdquo; is a work produced by combining or linking an
                            Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
                            with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &ldquo;Linked
                            Version&rdquo;.
                        </p>
                        <p>The &ldquo;Minimal Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
                            Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
                            for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
                            based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
                        </p>
                        <p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Application Code&rdquo; for a Combined Work means the
                            object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
                            and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
                            Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

                        <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
                            facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
                            that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
                            facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
                            version:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
                                ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
                                function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
                                whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
                            </li>
                            <li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
                                this License applicable to that copy.
                            </li>

                        <h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</h4>
                        <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
                            a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
                            code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
                            material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
                            layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
                            (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
                                Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
                                covered by this License.
                            </li>
                            <li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
                                document.
                            </li>

                        <h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Combined Works.</h4>
                        <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
                            taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
                            portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
                            engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
                            the following:

                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
                                the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
                                covered by this License.
                            </li>
                            <li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
                                document.
                            </li>
                            <li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
                                execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
                                these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
                                copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
                            </li>

                                d) Do one of the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
                                        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
                                        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
                                        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
                                        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
                                        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
                                        Corresponding Source.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                                        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
                                        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
                                        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                                        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
                                        Version.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
                                be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
                                GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
                                necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
                                Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
                                Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
                                you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
                                the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
                                Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
                                Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
                                for conveying Corresponding Source.)

                                is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the

                        <h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</h4>
                        <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
                            of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
                            versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
                            differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
                        </p>
                        <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
                            Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
                            of the GNU Lesser General Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo;
                            applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
                            conditions either of that published version or of any later version
                            published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
                            received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
                            General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
                            General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
                            whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
                            apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
                            permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
                            Library.
